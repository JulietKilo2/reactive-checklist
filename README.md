## DESCRIPTION
A react app that functions as a basic to-do list, utilizing React Hooks. 
The app includes a progression component that displays three indicators; the progression percentage, bar, and total number of tasks to be done and completed ones. 
All tasks and progresses are saved to the local storage, too.

## THE OUTCOME
Practice and demonstration of my understanding of the fundamentals of React; handling hooks (useState, useEffect), components with specific purposes, and usage of local storage. 

## THE STACK
HTML5, CSS3, React(React Hooks)

## WHAT'S THE VISION OF THE PROJECT?
As a portfolio project I want to demonstrate my understanding of basic usage of React components and how to make them reactive to changes in data.

## AT WHAT STAGE IS THE PROJECT?
At this stage the project is mostly finished, but I'm planning to add editing functionary in the future.
